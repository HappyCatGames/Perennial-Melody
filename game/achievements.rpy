## Achievements for Ren'Py by Feniks (feniksdev.itch.io / feniksdev.com) v1.5
##
################################################################################
## This file contains code for an achievement system in Ren'Py. It is designed
## as a wrapper to the built-in achievement system, so it hooks into the
## Steam backend as well if you set up your achievement IDs the same as in
## the Steam backend.
##
## You don't have to register the achievements or anything with the backend,
## or worry about syncing - that's all automatically done for you when the
## achievements are declared and granted.
##
## To get started, declare a few achievements below. Some samples are included.
## You may also replace the `image locked_achievement` image with something
## appropriate - this image is used as the default "Locked" image for all your
## achievements unless you specify something else.
##
## Then you can make a button to go to your achievement gallery screen, e.g.
# textbutton _("Achievements") action ShowMenu("achievement_gallery")
## This will show the achievement gallery screen, declared below. You can
## further customize it however you like.
## If you click on an achievement in the gallery during development (this will
## not happen in a release build), it will toggle the achievement on/off.
## This will also let you see the achievement popup screen, similarly declared
## below. It can be customized however you like.
##
## There's also an example label you can jump to via a line like
## `jump achievement_examples` which has examples of how to grant achievements
## and track progress during gameplay.
##
## If you use this code in your projects, credit me as Feniks @ feniksdev.com
##
## Leave a comment on the tool page on itch.io or an issue on the GitHub
## if you run into any issues.

## CONFIGURATION
################################################################################
## This is a configuration value which determines whether the in-game
## achievement popup should appear when Steam is detected. Since Steam
## already has its own built-in popup, you may want to set this to False
## if you don't want to show the in-game popup alongside it.
## The in-game popup will still work on non-Steam builds, such as builds
## released DRM-free on itch.io.
define myconfig.INGAME_POPUP_WITH_STEAM = False
## The length of time the in-game popup spends hiding itself (see
## transform achievement_popout below).
define myconfig.ACHIEVEMENT_HIDE_TIME = 1.0
## True if the game should show in-game achievement popups when an
## achievement is earned. You can set this to False if you just want an
## achievement gallery screen and don't want any popups.
define myconfig.SHOW_ACHIEVEMENT_POPUPS = True
## This can be set to a sound that plays when the achievement popup appears.
## None does not play a sound.
define myconfig.ACHIEVEMENT_SOUND = None # "audio/sfx/achievement.ogg"
## If the sound plays, this sets the channel it will play on. The audio
## channel plays on the sfx mixer, and can play overlapping sounds if multiple
## achievements are earned at once.
define myconfig.ACHIEVEMENT_CHANNEL = "audio"
## This is the default name and description used for hidden achievements, unless
## you provide a more specific one. See the examples below for how to do so.
define myconfig.HIDDEN_ACHIEVEMENT_NAME = _("???{#hidden_achievement_name}")
define myconfig.HIDDEN_ACHIEVEMENT_DESCRIPTION = _("???{#hidden_achievement_description}")

## A callback, or list of callbacks, which are called when an achievement
## is granted. It is called with one argument, the achievement which
## was granted. It is only called if the achievement has not previously
## been earned. See the README for more information.
define myconfig.ACHIEVEMENT_CALLBACK = [
    ## This first example is an achievement which unlocks after two other
    ## achievements have been granted ("hidden_achievement" and
    ## "hidden_description").
    LinkedAchievement(all_ends=['end_a', 'end_b', 'end_c', 'end_d']),
    ## The second example is an achievement which unlocks after all achievements
    ## have been granted. This is a special case.
    LinkedAchievement(platinum_achievement='all'),
    ## You may remove these examples!
]

## This is a built-in configuration value. It will set the position of
## the Steam popup. You can change this to any of the following:
## "top_left", "top_right", "bottom_left", "bottom_right"
## You may want to use this to ensure any Steam notifications don't conflict
## with the position of the built-in notification, if you're using both.
define achievement.steam_position = "top_right"

## DEFINING ACHIEVEMENTS
################################################################################
## Replace this with whatever locked image you want to use as the default
## for a locked achievement.

################################################################################
## Start of example achievement declarations and in-game examples.
## You may remove this code down to the "End of example achievement declarations"
## comment if you don't need it - they are simply examples.
################################################################################
## Example 1 ###################################################################
## This is how you declare achievements. You will use `define` and NOT
## `default`, so you can update the achievements later (you wouldn't want the
## description to be tied to a specific save file, for example).
## The order you declare achievements in is the order they will appear in the
## achievement gallery, by default.
define end_a_achievement = Achievement(
    ## The human-readable name, as it'll appear in the popup and in the gallery.
    name=_("thanks for the memories"),
    ## The id is used for Steam integration, and should match whatever ID
    ## you have set up in the Steam backend (if using).
    id="end_a",
    ## Description.
    description=_("Get ending A."),
    ## The image used in the popup and in the gallery once this achievement
    ## is unlocked.
    unlocked_image="gui/window_icon.png",
    ## By default all achievements use the "locked_achievement" image (declared
    ## above), but if you wanted to provide a different image, this is how
    ## you would specify it. It's used in the achievement gallery when the
    ## achievement is locked.
    locked_image="locked_achievement",
    ## All achievements are hide_name=False and hide_description=False by
    ## default, but you can change either to True to hide the name or
    ## description before the achievement is unlocked. See examples 4-7
    ## below for how to do this.
    hide_name=False,
    hide_description=True,
)
## You can grant an achievement in-game with `$ sample_achievement.grant()`
define end_b_achievement = Achievement(
    name=_("forget me not"),
    id="end_b",
    description=_("Get ending B"),
    unlocked_image="gui/window_icon.png",
    locked_image="locked_achievement",
    hide_description=True
)
define end_c_achievement = Achievement(
    name=_("the love that you want"),
    id="end_c",
    description=_("Get ending C"),
    unlocked_image="gui/window_icon.png",
    locked_image="locked_achievement",
    hide_description=True
)
define end_d_achievement = Achievement(
    name=_("the love that you deserve"),
    id="end_d",
    description=_("Get ending D"),
    unlocked_image="gui/window_icon.png",
    locked_image="locked_achievement",
    hide_description=True,
    hide_name=True
)
define end_all_achievement = Achievement(
    name=_("end all"),
    id="all_ends",
    description=_("Get every ending"),
    unlocked_image="gui/window_icon.png",
    locked_image="locked_achievement",
    hide_description=True,
    hide_name=True
)

## Example 2 ###################################################################
define set_interact_all_objects_achievement = Achievement(
    name=_("Meticulous"),
    id="meticulous_achievement",
    description=_("Interact with every item in your room."),
    unlocked_image=Transform("gui/window_icon.png", matrixcolor=InvertMatrix()),
    show_progress_bar=True,
    ## To record progress, you need to specify a stat_max. This means you can
    ## show a progress bar with % completion towards the achievement. It is
    ## useful if, for example, you have an achievement counting how many
    ## chapters the player has completed which unlocks when they have seen all
    ## the chapters.
    stat_max=16,
    ## You can also provide a stat_modulo, which means the achievement is only
    ## updated in the Steam backend every time the stat reaches a multiple of
    ## the modulo.
    ## Alternatively, this system also lets you set stat_update_percent instead,
    ## so if you want it to update every 10% it progresses, you can set
    # stat_update_percent=10
    ## This is most useful for achievements with a large number of steps,
    ## like a general % completion achievement. Maybe there are 600 things to
    ## complete for the achievement, but obviously 0.1% increments are pretty
    ## meaningless so you can either set stat_modulo=6 or stat_update_percent=1
    ## and it will update Steam every 6 steps or every 1%.
    ## The in-game bar/numbers will still update every increase.
    ##
    ## This shows the progress bar in the gallery. This is True by default if
    ## you have a stat_max, but you can set it to False if you don't want to
    ## show a bar (but do want to track progress).
)
## To update progress towards completion of this achievement, you can use
# $ progress_achievement.add_progress(1)
## where 1 is how much progress is added to the stat (so, the first time it
## is called for the above example it'd be 1/12, the second it'd be 2/12, etc).
##
## Alternatively, you can directly set the progress like:
# $ progress_achievement.progress(5)
## This will directly set progress to 5, making the above example 5/12 for
## example. Alternatively, you may want to make use of the built-in "set"
## functionality, seen below.

## Example 8 ###################################################################
## This -2 makes sure it's declared before the other achievements. This is
## so it shows up first in the list even though it's defined all the way down
## here.
define -2 all_achievements = Achievement(
    name=_("Platinum Achievement"),
    id="platinum_achievement",
    description=_("Congrats! You unlocked every achievement!"),
    unlocked_image=Transform("gui/window_icon.png", matrixcolor=BrightnessMatrix(1.0)),
    hide_description=_("Get all other achievements."),
)
